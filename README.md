# Quantum Prime Numbers Generator
### NO,, IS NOT what you may think at first .. 
### however, here, the word **Quantum** is properly used .. 

this is about a **prime number generator** can actually be done by just using TTL logic .. :D

and ..

it's about, GENERATE ANY of them  
( not just fermat or alike and specially not, using any sieve technique )    
it will fire them out one by one .. just like generator actually means ..  

the only exception is  
not to be able to jump to a specific N occurrence of a prime  
because a bit more complicated while still feasible in theory ..
